An SMS should always originate from a subscriber or go to a subscriber.
Hence, you have 2 modes to send a text SMS:
- Send from a subscriber: the SMS can be sent to any international phone number. 
- Send to a subscriber: the SMS can be sent from any international phone number or any text address.

Binary SMS are only allowed to be sent to a subscriber.
