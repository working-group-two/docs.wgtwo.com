# Why support user app uninstallation

We believe that letting third parties create apps for users that has access to the users calls, SMS, media, and more will revolutionize the mobile industry. However, letting third parties access such sensitive data, even with their consent, a high degree of trust is requried to make the user journey work.

It's for this reason we require that app developers support letting the user uninstall their apps in a uniform fashion, in a similar way to how they initially gave consent.
