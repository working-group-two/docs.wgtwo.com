# How to receive SMS

## Overview

The SMS API allows you to listen to all sent and received messages.
In order to access this API, your credentials need to have the `sms.receive.to_subscriber` and `sms.receive.from_subscriber` rights.
You can configure your credentials in [Console](https://console.wgtwo.com/api-keys-redirect).

All messages must be acknowledged after they are received, as they otherwise will be resent.

## Receive text SMS
Listen to text SMSes.

Note: this command does not acknowledge SMS, so messages will be resent after some time.

```shell script
grpcurl \
  -H "Authorization: Basic ${OPERATOR_TOKEN}"\
  -import-path . \
  -proto wgtwo/messaging/messagecore.proto \
  api.wgtwo.com:443 \
  messaging.MessageCore.ReceiveTextMessages
```

## Java / Kotlin

### Install dependencies
<JitpackDependency />

Then you can add `messaging-grpc` and `utils-grpc`:

<ClientDependencies :clients="['messaging-grpc', 'utils-grpc']"/>

## Receive text SMS
<GithubCode :to="$frontmatter.code" />
